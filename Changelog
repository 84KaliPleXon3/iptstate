1.1.0
- Released 03/30/02
- Will now read in all connections instead of just 50
   For single-line use, it will display them all as well.
- Added command line flag for reverse sorting
- Cleaned up reading of options

1.0.1
- Released 02/27/02
- Added spec file so people can build RPMs if the like
- Fix 'timeval' compile error for certain platforms.
	Bizzare bug, I'm guessing in GCC. On some platforms
	it wants to use sys/time.h. It will fail if you use 
	sys/select.h or time.h. Go figure.
- Take out src port and dst port for non tcp,udp cases
- Give 'rate' an initial value
- Fixed Big Endian Problem with command line arguments
- Fixed Makefile (put LIBS at end)
- Change "proto" field to look up by protocol number field of
	ip_conntrack instead of take it from the name field.
        This should now support pretty much any protocol. I 
	was unaware that ip_conntrack printed 'unknown' for 
	protos other than tcp, udp, and icmp.
