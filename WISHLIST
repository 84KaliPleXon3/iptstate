IPTSTATE WISHLIST
Current for version 2.1
This is the wishlist. READ IT BEFORE EMAILING ME.

Features coming soon:
- Filtering hostnames
- Inverse filtering

Features I may add if I have a lot of time or find a use for them
- Secondary sorting

Features I probably won't add because I'm not that interested, or 
Don't feel they belong, or would be too much work, or some
Combination therein.
- Full regex filtering
