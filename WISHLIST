IPTSTATE WISHLIST
Current for version 2.0
This is the wishlist. READ IT BEFORE EMAILING ME.

Features coming in the next version:
- Filtering hostnames
- Inverse filtering

Features I may add if I have a lot of time or find a use for them
- Secondary sorting

Features that would be cool but can't/won't happen
- I would like to show "number of packets" sent by a state, but
  /proc/net/ip_conntrack doesn't seem to store that information.
  If the cfnet stuff ever becomes used in the real world, I'll
  probably port iptstate to that and then be able to provide
  such a feature.

Features I probably won't add because I'm not that interested, or 
Don't feel they belong, or would be too much work, or some
Combination therein.
- Full regex filtering
