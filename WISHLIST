IPTSTATE WISHLIST
Current for version 1.2.1.
This is the wishlist. READ IT BEFORE EMAILING ME.

Features I really want to add
- Variable width of src and dst columns, atleast for interactive
  mode.
- Automatic refresh on terminal resize.

Features I may add if I have a lot of time or find a use for them
- Secondary sorting
- Filter particular IP's/names

Features that would be cool but can't/won't happen
- I would like to show "number of packets" sent by a state, but
  /proc/net/ip_conntrack doesn't seem to store that information.

Features I probably won't add because I'm not that interested, or 
Don't feel they belong, or would be too much work, or some
Combination therein.
- Full regex filtering
