IPTSTATE WISHLIST
Current for version 1.1.0.
This is the wishlist. READ IT BEFORE EMAILING ME.

Features I really want to add
- Proper IP sorting
- Optional DNS lookups
- Statistics

Features I may add if I have a lot of time or find a use for them
- Secondary sorting
- Filtering if output

Features that would be cool but can't/won't happen
- I would like to show "number of packets" sent by a state, but
  /proc/net/ip_conntrack doesn't seem to store that information.

Features I don't want to add, and won't add.
