IPTSTATE CONTRIBUTIONS

IPTState is written and maintained by Phil Dibowitz <phil@ipom.com>
I originally wrote the software not planning on releasing it - I wanted
a feature similar to IP Filter's StateTop when I was using Linux. I
decided to release it. It's become much bigger than I expected in just a
month.

Darren Reed wrote IP Filter.
Frank Volf wrote the Statetop code for IP Filter.

Garrick Staples is the maintainer of the IPTState package for Mandrake.
Brian Nelson is the maintainer of the IPTState package for Debian.
Bruce Locke is the maintainer of the IPTState package for Gentoo

Some people who helped me get this project started were Jullian Gomez, 
my fellow USCLUG'ers, and my friend Sanjay.

Other contributions follow based on version. If you contributed something
and you are not listed here, let me know, it's easy to forget to list
people:

1.2.1
- Thanks to Martin Geisler for pointing out the typo in the man page


1.2.0
- Thanks to Garrick for all your help troubleshooting and beta testing.


1.1.0
- Beat Bolli sent in a large patch that was a reference to finish up much
of the work I was doing for this version such as fixing TTL sort, and
various simplifications. His patch also reminded me to do the -R option,
notified me of the 'make uninstall' bug, and gave a few cleanups.

- Blars Blarson sent a patch to the Debian developers noting that I was
only reading in 50 connections. He also sent in a patch to print a
newline upon exiting state-top mode so the prompt isn't mixed in left-
over output.

- Many others made patches that did some of the above things in countless
ways...


1.0.1
- Thanks to Garrick Staples for the .spec file
